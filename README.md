This is just a showcase I made for a basic bookfinder using OpenAI API.
This uses Nextjs, Typescript, and Prisma, created using the WASP framework, that should explain some of the import statements.

Check out specifically the Bookfinder AI Showcase File with the DemoAppPage for the app formatting and logistics, and the operations.ts for the AI API stuff.
Those files have most of the typescript and HTML for the App itself, basically you type in the name of an author, and it prompts the AI API, then the API returns every book/article/comic etc, ever written by that author in a format called task.

Its not terribly sophisticated, just meant to demonstrate basic understanding of how to integrate software with an API, format the response, and do something with it using Typescript, HTML, and Tailwind.
This is part of a larger file that uses Prisma to add, delete, update, the author lists, but that was too many files, so I just added the important stuff.
