This is just a showcase I made for a basic bookfinder using OpenAI API.
This uses Nextjs, Typescript, and Prisma, created using the WASP framework, that should explain some of the import statements.

Check out specifically the Bookfinder File with the DemoAppPage for the app formatting and logistics, and the operations.ts for the AI API stuff.
